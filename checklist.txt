1. *.
example: println list*.size()

2. array in groovy is actually arraylist

3. As a GDK goody, there are more to* methods to convert a string, such as toInteger, toLong, toFloat, and toDouble.

4. map in groovy is default as linkedhashmap, which has the fixed order in iteration.

5. In Groovy, single-quoted strings are instances of java.lang.String. Double-quoted strings are "interpolated"strings, known (unfortunately) as GStrings. 

6. greeting = 'Hello'
greeting <<= ' Groovy'
assert greeting instanceof java.lang.StringBuffer

7. regex in the book groovy in action is skiped. should pick up once had time.

8. Dots traverse from parent elements to children, and @ signs represent attribute values.
def awayScore = boxscore.linescore[0].@away_team_runs

9. The last expression in a closure is returned automatically.

10. All Groovy exceptions are unchecked.

11. JSR 223 The JSR allows you to call Groovy scripts using purely Java classes.

12. run groovy in java: use groovyshell  GroovyShell shell = new GroovyShell(); Object result = shell.evaluate("3+4");

13. use binding and groovy shell and see making java groovy p58

14. def willow = [name:'Willow',id:2] as Person   -> map-based constructor

15. assert ['x','a','z'].grep(myList) == ['a']

16. list sort by closure: 
list = list.sort { item -> item.size() }     --> by size
list = list.sort { a,b -> a[0] <=> b[0] }    --> by first element

17. new HashSet(x).toList()

18. The GDK introduces two more convenience methods for lists: asImmutable and asSynchronized.

19. new File('myfile.txt').eachLine { println it }

20. inner class compare to closure:
// Java
   interface ResourceUser {
void use(Resource resource) }
resourceHandler.handle(new ResourceUser(){ public void use (Resource resource) {
        resoutce.doSomething()
ï¿¼} });

//Groovy
resourceHandler.handle { resource -> resource.doSomething() }

21. Closure works well with a variety of interfaces, which has evolved over time: Runnables, Observers, Listeners, Visitors,
Comparators, Strategies, Commands, Controllers, and so on.
